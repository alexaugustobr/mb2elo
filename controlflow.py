#This controlflow module is used for processing each line from start.sh stdout.  I'm using this stdout as an API to interface with the game.
#This log file was not designed to be used as such, so spaghetti code and excessive commenting is required in this module, as the stdout lines are inconsistent and just generally not designed with these scripts in mind, probably evident by the fact that noone has even attempted this
#Due to those issues, going to be a lot of weird one-time conditionals, but i will try my best to document what they do, and why they're in there.
#The main thread of this module (for now) continiously reads stdout, and starts a new thread to process each line separately to avoid skipping necessary data

#stdout examples:
#  ClientConnect: (J^4|^7P ^4b^7lake_^4w^7on) ID: 2 (IP: 178.220.143.189:29070)
#  1:32 say: J^4|^7Y ^4b^7lake_^4w^7on: !dummies
#  1:55 Kill: 0 0 7: J^4|^7Y ^4b^7lake_^4w^7on killed J^4|^7Y ^4b^7lake_^4w^7on by MOD_SUICIDE

#There's a few general rules of thumb in this script:

#timestamp string is the timestamp at the beggining of each log line
#event is a string usually right after the timpestamp, i presume its purpose is to describe the actual purpose of the log line, and im using it as such
#event_content is the actual content after the "event" instance
#pindex is an index of the player class in the actual list
#pid is the ingame playerID. that id is not a GUID, but rather a temporary id to signify which slot in the server is occupied by the player. (MAX IS 32)
