# MB2 ELO SYSTEM

This script is an implementation of an elo system for the popular mod Movie Battles 2. It works by reading the server log file, processing the lines, and outputting the results by socketing into said server. 

## Installing

Download or clone the files and put them in your GameData folder, and edit the mb2elo.cfg according to your needs. The script itself will start the server, so don't use the "sh start.sh" command to initialize your server.

### Prerequisites


```
Linux
Basic knowlege of hosting a Jedi Academy server
Python 3.7
Port 2090 forwarded through the gateway
```
